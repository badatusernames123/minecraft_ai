# Minecraft Block Recognition Project

## Overview
The Minecraft Block Recognition Project aims to develop a sophisticated model capable of identifying the specific type of block a player is looking at within the Minecraft game environment. Additionally, the model seeks to determine the distance between the player and the block. This project leverages machine learning techniques and Minecraft's rich, block-based architecture to create an interactive and immersive experience for players.

## Project Goals
- **Block Identification**: Accurately recognize and classify the type of block in the player's field of view.
- **Distance Measurement**: Calculate the distance from the player to the identified block, enhancing interaction dynamics within the game.

## Development Status
As of now, the project is in its early stages of development. The main objectives—block recognition and distance measurement—are under active research and development. The model has not yet achieved its intended functionality, but progress is ongoing, and updates will be provided as milestones are reached.
